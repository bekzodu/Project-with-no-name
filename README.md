# 📜 Contribution Guidelines
To maintain a high quality of code and a positive environment, we request contributors to follow these guidelines:

Relevancy: Ensure that all merges and commits are directly related to the project. This helps in maintaining the focus and integrity of the project.
Be Respectful: Respect is paramount. Every contributor is doing their best, and your approach should be constructive. If you find an error, guide them towards the right solution rather than demeaning their effort.
Avoid Trolling: This is a professional space. Any behavior construed as trolling will not be tolerated.
Constructive Feedback: If you spot a mistake in someone's code, point it out politely and suggest a possible solution.
Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in your contributions being declined or, in extreme cases, removal from the project.

# 📌 Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to uphold the principles of respect and helpfulness. We believe in the power of collective intelligence, and it shines the brightest when everyone is supportive.
